# 🌱 IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing an **IoT-based Smart Irrigation System** that automates plant watering based on real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data. By integrating **sensors, microcontrollers, and IoT connectivity**, the system optimizes water usage, reduces manual intervention, and enhances plant health.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Efficient Water Management**: Reduce water wastage by irrigating based on soil moisture levels.  
- **Automation**: Minimize manual effort using **microcontrollers and sensors**.  
- **Remote Monitoring**: Enable users to track and control the system via a **mobile app or web interface**.  
- **Scalability**: Suitable for home gardens, greenhouses, and large-scale agriculture.  

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
The system comprises:  
- **Sensor Module**: Soil moisture.  
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO for decision-making.  
- **Water Pump Control**: Automatic activation based on soil conditions.  
- **IoT & Communication**: Connect Arduino to PC via USB.  


## 📖 Research & Development  
We are actively researching existing **IoT-based irrigation solutions**, studying **academic papers**, and experimenting with different **hardware and software implementations** to develop an optimized system.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture, DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)   
- **Communication Protocols**: Wi-Fi
- **Programming**: Python, Node.js, Arduino IDE 

## 📌 Future Enhancements
